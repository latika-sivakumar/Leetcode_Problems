# Description:
#   Checks whether the input list 'arr' contains at least three consecutive odd numbers.
#   It maintains a counter 'c' that tracks the count of consecutive odd numbers.
#   If three or more consecutive odds are found, it returns True.
#   Otherwise, it resets the counter to 0 when an even number is encountered.

# Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input list.
#   - We iterate through the list once.

# Space Complexity: O(1)
#   - We use only a constant amount of extra space (the counter 'c').

            else:
