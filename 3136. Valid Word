# This function checks whether a given string `s` is valid based on the following rules:
# 1. The string must have at least 3 characters.
# 2. It must contain at least one vowel and at least one consonant.
# 3. All characters must be either letters or digits.
#    - Any special character (non-alphanumeric) makes the string invalid.

# Time Complexity:
# O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`.

# Space Complexity:
# O(1), only a fixed number of counters and a vowel set are used.

class Solution:

        for c in s:

                if c in vowel_set:
                    vowels += 1
                else:
                    consonants += 1
            elif not c.isdigit():
