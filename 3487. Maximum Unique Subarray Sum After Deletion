# - This function computes the maximum sum based on unique positive numbers in the list.
# - It first filters out positive numbers and adds them to a set to ensure uniqueness.
# - If there are no positive numbers (i.e., the set is empty or sums to 0), it returns the maximum element from the original list.
# - Otherwise, it returns the sum of all unique positive numbers.

# Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input list â€” for iteration and summing.
# Space Complexity: O(n), for storing the unique positive numbers in a set.
