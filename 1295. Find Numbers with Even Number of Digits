# This function counts how many numbers in the given list have an even number of digits.
# Approach:
# - Initialize a counter `c` to 0.
# - Iterate through each number in the list `nums`.
# - Convert the number to a string and check if the length of the string (i.e., number of digits) is even.
# - If the number of digits is even, increment the counter.
# - Finally, return the count of such numbers.

class Solution:
    def findNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        c=0
        for i in nums:
            if len(str(i))%2==0:
                c+=1
        return c
