# 1. Initialize an empty list to build the result string.
# 2. Iterate through each character in the string.
# 3. If the last two characters in the result list are the same as the current character, skip it.
# 4. Otherwise, append the character to the result list.
# 5. Finally, join and return the list as a string.

# Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

# Space Complexity: O(n), for storing the result string in a list.
