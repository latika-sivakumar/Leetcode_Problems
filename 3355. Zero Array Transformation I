# This function checks if it is possible to make all elements of the given array `nums` zero or less
# after performing a set of increment operations defined in `queries`.

# Each query [l, r] represents an operation where all elements from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) can be incremented by 1.
# The goal is to determine whether these operations, when applied optimally, can reduce every element in `nums` to zero or below.

# Approach:
# 1. Use a **difference array** `diff` to efficiently apply range increment operations.
# 2. Convert the difference array to actual counts using prefix sum.
# 3. For each index in `nums`, check if the number of operations is sufficient to reduce `nums[i]` to zero or less.

# Time Complexity: O(n + q), where:
#     - n is the length of the `nums` array
#     - q is the number of queries
# Explanation:
#     - O(q) to update the difference array
#     - O(n) to compute prefix sums and compare with `nums`

# Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of `nums`
#     - This is for the difference array `diff` of size n+1

    def isZeroArray(self, nums, queries):
        diff=[0]*(len(nums)+1)
        for l,r in queries:
            diff[l]+=1
            if r+1<len(nums):
                diff[r+1]-=1
        cnt=0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            cnt+=diff[i]
            if nums[i]>cnt:
                return False
        return True
