# Functionality:
# This function calculates the difference between the sum of numbers from 1 to n 
# that are **not divisible** by m and those that **are divisible** by m.

# Steps:
# 1. Iterate over the range from 1 to n (inclusive).
# 2. If the number is NOT divisible by m, add it to list `num1`.
# 3. If the number IS divisible by m, add it to list `num2`.
# 4. Return the result of `sum(num1) - sum(num2)`.

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# - We iterate from 1 to n once and perform constant-time operations for each i.

# Space Complexity: O(n)
# - In the worst case, all n numbers could be stored in num1 or num2.

class Solution:
    def differenceOfSums(self, n: int, m: int) -> int:
        num1=[]
        num2=[]
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            if i%m!=0:
                num1.append(i)
            else:
                num2.append(i)
        return sum(num1)-sum(num2)
