# The problem asks to determine the minimum number of rabbits in the forest given an array of answers.
# Each element in the array represents the number of other rabbits that a rabbit thinks have the same color as it.
# We need to calculate the minimum number of rabbits required based on these answers, ensuring the answers are consistent.
# 
# Approach:
# 1. We use a Counter to count how many times each unique answer appears in the array.
# 2. For each unique answer, we calculate how many groups of rabbits are needed to accommodate those that gave that answer.
#    - Each group corresponds to the answer plus one (because the rabbit itself is also counted in the group).
#    - We round up (using math.ceil) to ensure that any partial group is counted as a full group.
# 3. We sum the total rabbits required for all groups to find the minimum number of rabbits.
# 
# The solution ensures that the answers from the rabbits are consistent, and groups are formed optimally to minimize the number of rabbits.

class Solution:
    def numRabbits(self, answers: List[int]) -> int:
        c=Counter(answers)
        t=0
        for i in c:
            g_s=i+1
            g_c=math.ceil(c[i]/g_s)
            t+=g_s*g_c
        return t
