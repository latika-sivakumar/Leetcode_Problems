# Given a list of differences between elements of a hidden sequence
# and a value range [lower, upper], this code calculates how many
# possible hidden sequences can be formed such that:
# 1. The differences between consecutive elements match the input list.
# 2. All elements of the sequence stay within the [lower, upper] range.
# It does this by:
# - Tracking how high and low the sequence can go starting from 0.
# - Figuring out how many starting values keep the whole sequence in bounds.
