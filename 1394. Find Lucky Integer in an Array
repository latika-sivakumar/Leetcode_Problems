# This function finds the largest "lucky" integer in the list `arr`.
# A "lucky" integer is defined as an integer whose value is equal to its frequency in the array.
# - It uses a Counter to compute frequencies of all elements.
# - Iterates through the frequency map to find the largest such integer.
# - Returns -1 if no lucky number is found.

# Time Complexity:
# O(n), where n is the length of the input list `arr`.
# - Counting frequencies and iterating over unique elements both take linear time.

# Space Complexity:
# O(n), for storing the frequency map in the Counter.
